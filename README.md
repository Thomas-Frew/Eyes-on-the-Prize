# Eyes on the Prize
[Eyes on the Prize](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/Eyes-on-the-Prize) (previously known as Coin Runners) is a simple game I developed using JavaScript. Within the game, you play as an eyeball, using the arrow keys to move around to try to grab as many coins as possible! Several powerups may appear to help you along the way.

## Experience
Throughout this project, I have a vital aspect of JavaScript, namely interations of the Document Object Model (DOM) within the HTML and CSS documents to produce dynamic webpages. This is the entire backbone of my game, governing everything from hitboxes, to the placement of the coins, to the physical appearance of the sprites themselves.

## Durability
A main feature I wanted EotP to have was durability: it could be played on screens of almost any size and shape, thanks to simple CSS snippets such as:
```
width: 100%
```
and
```
bottom: 0px
```
EotP can now be played on iPads, Pixel 2s and almost every other device avaliable! I am contantly looking to find more ways to optimise EotP for many screen sizes.

## Issues
Although the game is virually bugless, there are still plenty of [improvements and optimisations to be made!](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/Eyes-on-the-Prize/issues) These include additional features, code minifying and redcution, and stylistic adjustments.

## Installation
To play EotP, all you need is the latest HTML, CSS and JavaScript documents, which can usually be found under [Releases](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/Eyes-on-the-Prize/releases). Nothing else is required for startup: just run the HTML document and enjoy!

*Eyes on the Prize is currently at version 2.0.0. See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) if you don't understand what this means.*
