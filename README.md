# Outline
Coin Runners is a simple game I developed using JavaScript. The aim is to collect as many coins as possible in a limited timespan.

# Experience
Throughout this project, I have a vital aspect of JS and HTML, namely interations of the Document Object Model (DOM), which helps bind dynamic webpages. CSS has also been integrated within the project to create dynamic graphics.

# Issues
There are currently many issues within the game. If you feel like solving any, head on over to https://github.com/ThomasFrew/Coin-Runners/issues, it would be a great help!

# Versions
The game is currently at version 1.0.0
