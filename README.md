# Outline
Coin Runners is a simple game I developed using JavaScript. The aim is to collect as many coins as possible in a limited timespan.

# Experience
Throughout this project, I have a vital aspect of JS and HTML, namely interations of the Document Object Model (DOM), which helps bind dynamic webpages. CSS has also been integrated within the project to create dynamic graphics.

# Issues
I have taken a shortcut for the Game Over text: you can physically select it, even before the game is up. Although unsolved now, I hope to work on this minor issue in the future.

There is also a chance that coins or powerups on the edges of the screen are physically unreachable while a powerup is active. However, this issue can simply be resolved by adjusting the range in which the coins can spawn.

# Versions
The game is currently at version 1.0.0
